## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(nnet)### get this if you don't
library(e1071) ## get this if you don't
library(openintro)

## make a dummy for default
```

library(openintro)You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
```

```{r}
Credit <- ISLR2::Credit
Credit
```

```{r}

Credit|>
  mutate(
    gender_encod = ifelse(
      Own == "Yes",
      1,0
    )
  )-> def_dum
  
  
  
# Creating the dummy variables
def_dum |>
  mutate(
    student_encod = ifelse(
      Student == "Yes",
      1,0
    )
  )-> def_dum
```

```{r}
## Run the logistic regression

glm(
  def_dum ~ Region,
  data = def_dum,
  family = binomial
)|>
  broom::augment(type.predict = "response")-> df


```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
